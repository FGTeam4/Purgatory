# Seventh Circle (working name Purgatory)
Seventh Circle is a first-person puzzle game set in a 1950's film noir surreal setting.

Lars is stuck in his personal hell, forced to re-live his worst nightmare over and over, until he collects his scattered memories to piece together the moment that got him into hell.

Seventh Circle was developed in Unreal Engine 4 in four weeks as a part of a game project at Futuregames, a higher vocational education for game development, in Stockholm, Sweden.
